Why Rental Scams Target Newcomers

Finding a safe, affordable home is one of the first significant challenges most newcomers face. The search often starts with urgency and high hopes, whether you're browsing Kijiji listings late at night or juggling apartment tours between job interviews and immigration paperwork. But in this critical window, newcomers are especially vulnerable to rental scams.

Why? Because when you're new to Canada, you might not yet know what "normal" looks like: how much rent typically costs in your area, what paperwork is standard, or what rights tenants have. You may be unfamiliar with the platforms or processes. Add to that language barriers, financial pressure, or the stress of finding housing before a deadline, and it becomes easier for scammers to take advantage.

But you are not powerless. You can protect yourself with some knowledge and a few smart boundaries. Here's how to spot red flags, move wisely, and still find the home you're looking for — without fear.

1\. If It Seems Too Good to Be True — Pause and Investigate

Scammers rely on listings that look too perfect. You might find a spacious, fully furnished, downtown apartment listed for $800—utilities included, no lease required, no references asked. It feels like a dream.

But the dream is often bait. Scammers pull attractive photos from real listings and create fake ads to grab attention. Slow down if a deal looks drastically better than others in the area. Cross-check similar properties in the same neighbourhood. Is this one oddly cheap or unusually flexible? Ask yourself why.

When something feels off, your instincts are often correct.

2\. Never Send Money Before Seeing the Place (In Person or Online)

One of the most common scam techniques is pushing you to send a deposit before a showing. You might hear:

* "I'm out of the country but can mail you the keys."
* "There are a lot of applicants. Send your deposit now to reserve it."

Real landlords understand that serious tenants want to see a place before paying. If someone avoids viewings or won’t allow a virtual tour, that’s a red flag. Scammers will often ask for payment through e-Transfer, PayPal, or even cryptocurrency, making it difficult to recover your money later.

Instead, insist on a showing. If you're not in Canada, ask someone you trust locally to visit the property or request a live virtual tour with the landlord.

Never transfer funds unless you have:

* Seen the unit (virtually or in person)
* Confirmed the person’s identity
* Reviewed and signed a proper lease

3\. Always Request a Lease and Landlord Identification

Legitimate rentals come with legitimate paperwork. In most provinces, landlords are required to use a standard lease agreement. Be cautious if someone avoids contracts or gives vague answers about rent, rules, or deposits.

Ask for a lease that clearly states:

* The address and unit
* Monthly rent and due date
* Term of the lease (e.g., one year, month-to-month)
* Responsibilities for utilities and repairs

You should also feel comfortable asking the landlord for proof of basic identification or ownership. This could include:

* A government-issued ID
* Proof of ownership (e.g., property tax document)
* A business card or company website if they represent a rental agency

If they hesitate or dismiss your request, consider it a warning sign.

4\. Be Cautious With Facebook Marketplace and Kijiji

Online platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and Kijiji are full of real listings — and unfortunately, just as many fakes. Scammers often copy legitimate ads, reuse stolen photos, and create urgency to pressure you.

Watch for these clues:

* Listings with perfect images and very little detail
* Requests to move the conversation off-platform quickly
* Poor spelling or grammar in messages
* Overly eager responses, especially if you haven’t provided much information yet

When in doubt, take extra steps:

* Reverse image search listing photos to see if they appear elsewhere
* Ask for a video tour or FaceTime call
* Cross-reference the address on other rental websites (rentals.ca, PadMapper, or Realtor.ca)

The more you verify, the more confident you’ll feel.

5\. Trust Your Gut — And Take Your Time

Scammers use urgency as a tool. They’ll say things like:

* "There are five other people interested. If you don’t act now, you’ll miss it."
* "I’ll only wait for your deposit until the end of the day."

This pressure is designed to bypass your caution. But you deserve time to review, ask questions, and understand what you’re signing up for.

Take a breath. Ask someone you trust for their opinion. Research the average rent in that area. Talk to a settlement worker or visit a tenant rights resource. In Ontario, for example, community legal clinics can answer housing questions for free.

A safe home is worth the extra time.

Choose Wisdom Over Worry

Being new to Canada shouldn’t make you a target. It should protect you. With every step you take — asking questions, reviewing documents, pausing when things feel rushed — you’re building safety and self-trust.

Scammers may be clever, but you are capable. With information and support, you can find an affordable and secure home.

Keep your heart open. Keep your eyes sharp. Your new beginning deserves both.
