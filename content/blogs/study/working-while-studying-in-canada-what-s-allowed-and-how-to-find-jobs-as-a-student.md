Understanding Work-Study Options in Canada: A Guide for International Students

Canada is not just a beautiful place to study—it’s also a country that encourages students to gain hands-on experience, develop life skills, and earn while they learn. If you’re an international student wondering whether you can work while studying, the answer is yes, but with essential conditions.

As of late 2024, international students in Canada are allowed to work up to 24 hours per week off-campus during academic sessions, and full-time during scheduled breaks (like winter holidays, summer break, or spring reading week), provided they return to studies afterwards. This flexibility is designed to help students support themselves while focusing on their education. Meanwhile, on-campus jobs are not subject to the 24-hour limit, so you can take advantage of those opportunities without breaching government rules.

But it’s not a free-for-all. You must be enrolled full-time at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI), and your study permit must clearly state that you can work. You can only begin working once your academic term has started, not before. One more thing: to work legally in Canada, you need a Social Insurance Number (SIN)—your personal identification number for taxes and employment. Don’t worry—we’ll walk you through how to get one below.

Following these rules isn’t just about compliance—it protects your student status. Violating work restrictions could jeopardise your right to stay in Canada. So let’s explore how to navigate this smartly, safely, and successfully.




School First, Always: Balancing Work and Study

There’s no denying the financial pressure that comes with international student life. Rent, groceries, transit passes, textbooks—and yes, the occasional warm cup from Tim Hortons—all cost money. Working can ease that burden, but your studies must remain your top priority. That’s the balance Canada expects, which you’ll need to manage carefully.

Think of your weekly schedule like a budget. If you’ve 40 hours a week to “spend” outside of class, how many should go to studying, how many to work, and how many to rest? For most, a part-time job between 10 and 20 hours a week is sustainable. It’s enough to earn an income without sacrificing academic success or mental health.

Working teaches soft skills employers love: punctuality, teamwork, communication, and multitasking. Whether you’re helping customers at a grocery store in Winnipeg or working tech support on campus in Ottawa, these lessons stick. But remember, exhaustion helps no one. If you feel overwhelmed, reassess. You are not failing by cutting back hours—you are wisely investing in yourself.




Your Work-Ready Checklist: Permits, SIN, and Resumes

Before applying for jobs, check your study permit. It should include a remark that you’re eligible to work off-campus. If it doesn’t, you can request a free update from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). This step is vital. You’re not legally allowed to work without the proper permit conditions, even if you meet all other criteria.

Next, apply for your Social Insurance Number (SIN). This is your key to getting hired and paid. You can apply online or visit a Service Canada office with your passport and study permit. The process is simple; you’ll typically receive your number the same day. Once you have your SIN, you're legally ready to work.

Now, craft a Canadian-style résumé. It should be one to two pages, no photo, age, or marital status. List your education, relevant experience (even from your home country), volunteer work, and soft skills. Keep it honest and focused on your strengths. Many universities offer free résumé reviews and mock interviews through their career centres—take advantage.

One of our own landed a tutoring job in Regina just by attending a résumé workshop and applying immediately after. Small steps, taken with preparation and intention, make a big difference.




Start Close: Finding Jobs on Campus

Your first job might be right down the hallway. Colleges and universities in Canada offer various on-campus jobs—library assistants, event staff, food service workers, lab assistants, and more. These roles are tailored for students: flexible, understanding of exam schedules, and often managed by people who know what student life feels like.

Better still, on-campus jobs aren’t subject to the 24-hour rule. That means you can work extra hours on campus if it doesn’t interfere with your studies or health.

Check your school’s student job board or visit the career or international student services office to find these jobs. Ask about work-study programs, often pair eligible students with part-time roles funded by the institution. And don’t underestimate the power of asking your professors or advisors—some departments hire assistants quietly, and your initiative might open a door.

Beyond income, campus jobs can help you meet people, build confidence, and settle in. Plus, when winter hits hard, not having to commute across town for work is a blessing you’ll deeply appreciate.




Off-Campus Opportunities: Expanding Your Reach

Once you're confident in your schedule and ready to explore the broader job market, off-campus work is a fantastic way to integrate into Canadian society. You’ll meet locals, improve your language skills, and experience Canadian workplace culture up close.

Student-friendly roles off-campus include positions in retail stores, coffee shops, delivery services, restaurants, customer support centres, tutoring, and even freelancing (if you stick to legal guidelines). Apply with a positive attitude and a tailored résumé. Competition is tougher in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, but options are more diverse. In smaller towns, community referrals often carry more weight.

Some students walk into stores with printed résumés and a smile—still one of the most effective methods. Others find jobs through online platforms like:

* Indeed.ca
* LinkedIn
* Glassdoor
* Job Bank (Government of Canada)

Tap into student communities on WhatsApp, Facebook, or Discord—these are often gold mines for job leads. We've seen classmates in places like Thunder Bay land babysitting jobs through word-of-mouth or volunteering at cultural events, eventually leading to paid gigs.

Be mindful of your hours: if you're working two part-time jobs (tutoring and retail), the combined total must not exceed 24 hours per week during the academic session. A small spreadsheet or calendar reminder can help you track this efficiently.




Tap Into Your Network: You’re Not Alone

The most underrated job-hunting tool is community. Your classmates, professors, dorm neighbours, and even those next to you at a cultural event might know of an opportunity or be willing to refer you.

Canadians are generally warm and helpful, especially to students showing initiative. Ask questions. Let people know you’re job-hunting. A professor might need a research assistant. A fellow student might be quitting their café job and can put in a good word for you. We’ve seen it happen many times.

And don’t overlook the career services and workshops your school offers. Whether it’s a job fair, an “Intro to LinkedIn” class, or a free headshot day for your résumé, these are built to help you succeed. Show up—you never know what door might open.

Finally, stay emotionally supported. Studying abroad is exhilarating but also draining at times. Stay connected with others, take breaks when needed, and don’t hesitate to seek help from school counsellors or community mentors. Building a life in Canada takes time, and every small step counts.


Your First Job, Your First Chapter

Finding a job while studying in Canada isn’t just about earning money and building a foundation. You’ll grow in confidence, language, professionalism, and cultural awareness. You’ll make mistakes and learn from them. You’ll work a shift on a freezing winter day and come home tired but proud.

We remember those days vividly: our first resumes were handed out nervously, our first job interviews were conducted in hesitant English, and our first tax returns were filed with the help of a friendly advisor. And now, we’re here helping you.

So, whether applying at a downtown Toronto bookstore or helping out in a Regina research lab, know that every job adds a chapter to your Canadian story. Walk into it with your head high, your paperwork in order, and your heart open. You’ve got this.

And when in doubt, remember, we’re here for you.
