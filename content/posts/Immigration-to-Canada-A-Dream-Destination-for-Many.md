## 🛂 How to Immigrate to Canada?

There are multiple pathways to becoming a permanent resident in Canada:

### 1. Express Entry (For Skilled Workers)

The Express Entry system is one of the fastest ways for skilled workers to immigrate. It is based on a points system (CRS Score), which considers factors like:

* Age
* Education
* Work Experience
* Language Proficiency (English/French)
* Job Offer (optional)

### 2. Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)

Each province in Canada has its own immigration program designed to meet local labor needs. If you have skills that match a province’s requirements, you can get nominated and fast-track your immigration.

### 3. Family Sponsorship

If you have a spouse, children, or parents who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents, they can sponsor you for immigration.

### 4. Student Visa → Permanent Residency

Many immigrants come to Canada first as international students, complete their education, and then apply for permanent residency (PR) under programs like the Post-Graduate Work Permit (PGWP).
